# API reference

In general, using `help(symbol)` is the recommended way to get the latest documentation. In addition, this page provides an overview of the various elements in this package.

## 1 - Fixtures

### `current_cases`

A fixture containing [`get_current_cases(request)`](#get_current_cases).

This is a dictionary containing all case parameters for the currently active `pytest` item. For each test function argument parametrized using a [`@parametrize_with_case(<argname>, ...)`](#parametrize_with_cases) this dictionary contains an entry `{<argname>: (case_id, case_function, case_params)}`. If several argnames are parametrized this way, a dedicated entry will be present for each argname. The tuple is a `namedtuple` containing 
    
     - `id` a string containing the actual case id constructed by `@parametrize_with_cases`.
     - `function` the original case function.
     - `params` a dictionary, containing the parameters of the case, if itself is parametrized. Note that if the
    case is parametrized with `@parametrize_with_cases`, the associated parameter value in the dictionary will also be
    `(case_id, case_function, case_params)`.

If a fixture parametrized with cases is active, the dictionary will contain an entry `{<fixturename>: <dct>}` where `<dct>` is a dictionary `{<argname>: (case_id, case_function, case_params)}`.

To get more information on a case function, you can use [`get_case_marks(f)`](#get_case_marks), [`get_case_tags(f)`](#get_case_tags). You can also use [`matches_tag_query`](#matches_tag_query) to check if a case function matches some expectations either concerning its id
or its tags. See [filters and tags documentation](https://smarie.github.io/python-pytest-cases/#filters-and-tags).

## 2 - Case functions

As explained in the [documentation](index.md), case functions have no requirement anymore, and starting from version 2.0.0 of `pytest_cases` they can be parametrized with the usual `@pytest.mark.parametrize` or its improvement [`@parametrize`](#parametrize). Therefore the only remaining decorator is the optional `@case` decorator:

### `@case`

```python
@case(id=None,    # type: str  # noqa
      tags=None,  # type: Union[Any, Iterable[Any]]
      marks=(),   # type: Union[MarkDecorator, Iterable[MarkDecorator]]
      )
```

Optional decorator for case functions so as to customize some information.

```python
@case(id='hey')
def case_hi():
    return 1
```

**Parameters:**

 - `id`: the custom pytest id that should be used when this case is active. Replaces the deprecated `@case_name` decorator from v1. If no id is provided, the id is generated from case functions by removing their prefix, see [`@parametrize_with_cases(prefix='case_')`](#parametrize_with_cases).

 - `tags`: custom tags to be used for filtering in [`@parametrize_with_cases(has_tags)`](#parametrize_with_cases). Replaces the deprecated `@case_tags` and `@target` decorators.

 - `marks`: optional pytest marks to add on the case. Note that decorating the function directly with the mark also works, and if marks are provided in both places they are merged.


### `copy_case_info`

```python
def copy_case_info(from_fun,  # type: Callable
                   to_fun     # type: Callable
                   ):
```

Copies all information from case function `from_fun` to `to_fun`.


### `set_case_id`

```python
def set_case_id(id,        # type: str
                case_func  # type: Callable
                ):
```

Sets an explicit id on case function `case_func`.


### `get_case_id`

```python
def get_case_id(case_func,                      # type: Callable
                prefix_for_default_ids='case_'  # type: str
                ):
```

Return the case id associated with this case function.

If a custom id is not present, a case id is automatically created from the function name based on removing the provided prefix if present at the beginning of the function name. If the resulting case id is empty, "<empty_case_id>" will be returned.


**Parameters:**

 - `case_func`: the case function to get a case id for.
 
 - `prefix_for_default_ids`: this prefix that will be removed if present on the function name to form the default case id.


### `get_case_marks`

```python
def get_case_marks(case_func,                         # type: Callable
                   concatenate_with_fun_marks=False,  # type: bool
                   as_decorators=False                # type: bool
                   ):
```

Return the marks that are on the case function.

There are currently two ways to place a mark on a case function: either with `@pytest.mark.<name>` or in `@case(marks=...)`. This function returns a list of marks containing either both (if `concatenate_with_fun_marks` is `True`) or only the ones set with `@case` (`concatenate_with_fun_marks` is `False`, default).

**Parameters:**

 - `case_func`: the case function

 - `concatenate_with_fun_marks`: if `False` (default) only the marks declared in `@case` will be returned. Otherwise a concatenation of marks in `@case` and on the function (for example directly with `@pytest.mark.<mk>`) will be returned.

 - `as_decorators`: when `True`, the marks (`MarkInfo`) will be transformed into `MarkDecorators` before being returned. Otherwise (default) the marks are returned as is.


### `get_case_tags`

```python
def get_case_tags(case_func  # type: Callable
                  ):
```

Return the tags on this case function or an empty tuple.

**Parameters:**

 - `case_func`: the case function


### `matches_tag_query`

```python
def matches_tag_query(case_fun,      # type: Callable
                      has_tag=None,  # type: Union[str, Iterable[str]]
                      filter=None,   # type: Union[Callable[[Callable], bool], Iterable[Callable[[Callable], bool]]]  # noqa
                      ):
```

This function is the one used by `@parametrize_with_cases` to filter the case functions collected. It can be used manually for tests/debug.

Returns True if the case function is selected by the query:

 - if `has_tag` contains one or several tags, they should ALL be present in the tags set on `case_fun` (`get_case_tags`)

 - if `filter` contains one or several filter callables, they are all called in sequence and the `case_fun` is only selected if ALL of them return a `True` truth value

**Parameters:**

 - `case_fun`: the case function

 - `has_tag`: one or several tags that should ALL be present in the tags set on `case_fun` for it to be selected.

 - `filter`: one or several filter callables that will be called in sequence. If all of them return a `True` truth value, `case_fun` is selected.


### `is_case_class`

```python
def is_case_class(cls,                         # type: Any
                  case_marker_in_name='Case',  # type: str
                  check_name=True              # type: bool
                  ):
```

This function is the one used by `@parametrize_with_cases` to collect cases within classes. It can be used manually for tests/debug.

Returns True if the given object is a class and, if `check_name=True` (default), if its name contains `case_marker_in_name`.

**Parameters:**

 - `cls`: the object to check
    
 - `case_marker_in_name`: the string that should be present in a class name so that it is selected. Default is 'Case'.

 - `check_name`: a boolean (default True) to enforce that the name contains the word `case_marker_in_name`. If False, any class will lead to a `True` result whatever its name.

### `is_case_function`

```python
def is_case_function(f,                 # type: Any
                     prefix='case_',    # type: str
                     check_prefix=True  # type: bool
                     ):
```

This function is the one used by `@parametrize_with_cases` to collect cases. It can be used manually for tests/debug.
    
Returns True if the provided object is a function or callable and, if `check_prefix=True` (default), if it starts with `prefix`.

**Parameters:**

 - `f`: the object to check
    
 - `prefix`: the string that should be present at the beginning of a function name so that it is selected. Default is 'case_'.

 - `check_prefix`: if this boolean is True (default), the prefix will be checked. If False, any function will lead to a `True` result whatever its name.

### The `filters` submodule

This submodule contains symbols to help you create filters for `@parametrize_with_cases(filter=...)`.

All helper filters in this submodule return an instance of `CaseFilter`, so that you can combine them easily with "and" (`&`) "or" (`|`) and "invert" (`~`) in order to create new custom filters.

#### `has_tag`

```python
def has_tag(tag_name: str)
```

Selects cases that have the tag `tag_name`. See `@case(tags=...)` to add tags to a case.

#### `has_tags`

```python
def has_tags(*tag_names: str)
```

Selects cases that have all tags `tag_names`. See `@case(tags=...)` to add tags to a case.

#### `id_has_prefix`

```python
def id_has_prefix(prefix: str)
```

Selects cases that have a case id prefix `prefix`. Note that this is not the prefix of the whole case function name, but the case id, possibly overridden with `@case(id=)`

#### `id_has_suffix`

```python
def id_has_suffix(suffix: str)
```

Selects cases that have a case id suffix `suffix`. Note that this is not the suffix of the whole case function name, but the case id, possibly overridden with `@case(id=)`


#### `id_match_regex`

```python
def id_match_regex(regex: str)
```

Selects cases that have a case id matching regex pattern `regex`. Note that this is not a match of the whole case function name, but the case id, possibly overridden with `@case(id=)`

#### `CaseFilter`

```python
CaseFilter(filter_function: Callable)
```

`CaseFilter` is the class used by all filters above, and implementing logical operations "and" (`&`) "or" (`|`) and "not" (`~`). You can use it to define a composable filter from any callable receiving a single `case` argument and returning a boolean indicating if the `case` is selected.

## 3 - Cases collection

### `@parametrize_with_cases`

```python
CaseType = Union[Callable, Type, ModuleRef]

@parametrize_with_cases(argnames: str,
                        cases: Union[CaseType, List[CaseType]] = AUTO,
                        prefix: str = 'case_',
                        glob: str = None,
                        has_tag: Union[str, Iterable[str]] = None,
                        filter: Callable = None,
                        ids: Union[Callable, Iterable[str]] = None,
                        idstyle: Union[str, Callable] = None,
                        scope: str = "function",
                        import_fixtures: bool = False
                        )
```

A decorator for test functions or fixtures, to parametrize them based on test cases. It works similarly to [`@pytest.mark.parametrize`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/parametrize.html): argnames represent a coma-separated string of arguments to inject in the decorated test function or fixture. The argument values (`argvalues` in [`@pytest.mark.parametrize`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/parametrize.html)) are collected from the various case functions found according to `cases`, and injected as lazy values so that the case functions are called just before the test or fixture is executed.

By default (`cases=AUTO`) the list of test cases is automatically drawn from the python module file named `test_<name>_cases.py` or if not found, `case_<name>.py`,  where `test_<name>` is the current module name.

Finally, the `cases` argument also accepts an explicit case function, cases-containing class, module or module name; or a list containing any mix of these elements. Note that both absolute and relative module names are supported.

Note that `@parametrize_with_cases` collection and parameter creation steps are strictly equivalent to [`get_all_cases`](#get_all_cases) + [`get_parametrize_args`](#get_parametrize_args). This can be handy for debugging purposes.

```python
# Collect all cases
cases_funs = get_all_cases(f, cases=cases, prefix=prefix,
                           glob=glob, has_tag=has_tag, filter=filter)

# Transform the various functions found
argvalues = get_parametrize_args(host_class_or_module_of_f, cases_funs)
```

**Parameters**

 - `argnames`: same than in `@pytest.mark.parametrize`
 
 - `cases`: a case function, a class containing cases, a module object or a module name string (relative module names accepted). Or a list of such items. You may use `THIS_MODULE` or `'.'` to include current module. `AUTO` (default) means that the module named `test_<name>_cases.py` or if not found, `case_<name>.py`, will be loaded, where `test_<name>.py` is the module file of the decorated function. When a module is listed, all of its functions matching the `prefix`, `filter` and `has_tag` are selected, including those functions nested in classes following naming pattern `*Case*`. Nested subclasses are taken into account, as long as they follow the `*Case*` naming pattern. When classes are explicitly provided in the list, they can have any name and do not need to follow this `*Case*` pattern.

 - `prefix`: the prefix for case functions. Default is 'case_' but you might wish to use different prefixes to denote different kind of cases, for example 'data_', 'algo_', 'user_', etc.

 - `glob`: a matching pattern for case ids, for example `*_success` or `*_failure`. The only special character that can be used for now in this pattern is `*`, it can not be escaped, and it can be used several times in the same expression. The pattern should match the entire case id for the case to be selected. Note that this is applied on the case id, and therefore if it is customized through [`@case(id=...)`](#case) it will be taken into account.

 - `has_tag`: a single tag or a tuple, set, list of tags that should be matched by the ones set with the [`@case`](#case) decorator on the case function(s) to be selected.

 - `filter`: a callable receiving the case function and returning `True` or a truth value in case the function needs to be selected.
 
 - `ids`: optional custom ids, similar to the one in `pytest.mark.parametrize`. Users may either provide an iterable of string ids, or a callable. If a callable is provided it will receive the case functions. Users may wish to use [`get_case_id`](#get_case_id) or other helpers in the [API](#2-case-functions) to inspect the case functions.

 - `idstyle`: This is mostly for debug. Style of ids to be used in the "union" fixtures generated by [`@parametrize`](#parametrize) if some cases are transformed into fixtures behind the scenes. `idstyle` possible values are `'compact'`, `'explicit'` or `None`/`'nostyle'` (default), or a callable. `idstyle` has no effect if no cases are transformed into fixtures. As opposed to `ids`, a callable provided here will receive a `ParamAlternative` object indicating which generated fixture should be used. See [`@parametrize`](#parametrize) for details.

 - `scope`: The scope of the union fixture to create if `fixture_ref`s are found in the argvalues

 - `import_fixtures`: experimental feature. Turn this to `True` in order to automatically import all fixtures defined in the cases module into the current module.

### `get_current_cases`

```python
def get_current_cases(request_or_item):
```

Returns a dictionary containing all case parameters for the currently active `pytest` item. You can either pass the `pytest` item (available in some hooks) or the `request` (available in hooks, and also directly as a fixture).

For each test function argument parametrized using a [`@parametrize_with_case(<argname>, ...)`](#parametrize_with_cases) this dictionary contains an entry `{<argname>: (case_id, case_function, case_params)}`. If several argnames are parametrized this way, a dedicated entry will be present for each argname. The tuple is a `namedtuple` containing 
    
     - `id` a string containing the actual case id constructed by `@parametrize_with_cases`.
     - `function` the original case function.
     - `params` a dictionary, containing the parameters of the case, if itself is parametrized. Note that if the
    case is parametrized with `@parametrize_with_cases`, the associated parameter value in the dictionary will also be
    `(case_id, case_function, case_params)`.

If a fixture parametrized with cases is active, the dictionary will contain an entry `{<fixturename>: <dct>}` where `<dct>` is a dictionary `{<argname>: (case_id, case_function, case_params)}`.

To get more information on a case function, you can use [`get_case_id(f)`](#get_case_id), [`get_case_marks(f)`](#get_case_marks), [`get_case_tags(f)`](#get_case_tags). You can also use [`matches_tag_query`](#matches_tag_query) to check if a case function matches some expectations either concerning its id
or its tags. See [filters and tags documentation](https://smarie.github.io/python-pytest-cases/#filters-and-tags).

Note that you can get the same contents directly by using the [`current_cases`](#current_cases) fixture.

### `get_all_cases`

```python
CaseType = Union[Callable, Type, ModuleRef]

def get_all_cases(parametrization_target: Callable,
                  cases: Union[CaseType, List[CaseType]] = None,
                  prefix: str = 'case_',
                  glob: str = None,
                  has_tag: Union[str, Iterable[str]] = None,
                  filter: Callable[[Callable], bool] = None
                  ) -> List[Callable]:
```
Collect all cases as used with [`@parametrize_with_cases`](#parametrize_with_cases). See [`@parametrize_with_cases`](#parametrize_with_cases) for more details on the parameters.
This can be used to lists all desired cases for a given `parametrization_target` (a test function or a fixture) which may be convenient for debugging purposes.

```python
# Get the cases for f that are defined in the current file
cases = get_all_cases(f, cases=".")

# Get the cases from cases_xyz.py or test_xyz_cases.py
import test.test_xyz
xyz_cases = get_all_cases(test.test_xyz)

# Can be used to filter explict cases, in which case no parametrization_target is needed
filtered_cases = get_all_cases(cases=[case_1, case_2, case_3], has_tag=["banana"])
```

 - If using a `cases` argument that requires module information, such as `"."` `AUTO` or a relative module like `".xyz"`, the value of `parametrization_target` will be used to to determine the context.
 If `None` or simply left empty, it will use the module from which `get_all_cases` was called.
 You can pass an explicit module object or a function, in which case the module in which it's defined will be used.


### `get_parametrize_args`

```python
def get_parametrize_args(host_class_or_module: Union[Type, ModuleType],
                         cases_funs: List[Callable],
                         debug: bool = False
                         ) -> List[Union[lazy_value, fixture_ref]]:
```

Transforms a list of cases (obtained from [`get_all_cases`](#get_all_cases)) into a list of argvalues for [`@parametrize`](#parametrize). Each case function `case_fun` is transformed into one or several [`lazy_value`](#lazy_value)(s) or a [`fixture_ref`](#fixture_ref):

 - If `case_fun` requires at least on fixture, a fixture will be created if not yet present, and a `fixture_ref` will be returned.

 - If `case_fun` is a parametrized case, one `lazy_value` with a partialized version will be created for each parameter combination.

 - Otherwise, `case_fun` represents a single case: in that case a single `lazy_value` is returned.

## 4 - Pytest goodies

### `@fixture`

```python
@fixture(scope: str = "function", 
         autouse: bool = False, 
         name: str = None, 
         unpack_into: Iterable[str] = None,
         hook: Callable = None,
         **kwargs)
```

Identical to `@pytest.fixture` decorator, except that 

 - when used in a fixture union (either explicit `fixture_union` or indirect through `@parametrize`+`fixture_ref` or `@parametrize_with_cases`), it will not be setup/teardown unnecessarily in tests that do not require it.

 - it supports multi-parametrization with `@pytest.mark.parametrize` as requested in [pytest#3960](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3960). As a consequence it does not support the `params` and `ids` arguments anymore.
 
 - it supports a new argument `unpack_into` where you can provide names for fixtures where to unpack this fixture into.

As a consequence it does not support the `params` and `ids` arguments anymore.

**Parameters:**

 - **scope**: the scope for which this fixture is shared, one of "function" (default), "class", "module" or "session".
 - **autouse**: if True, the fixture func is activated for all tests that can see it.  If False (the default) then an explicitreference is needed to activate the fixture.
 - **name**: the name of the fixture. This defaults to the name of the decorated function. Note: If a fixture is used in the same module in which it is defined, the function name of the fixture will be shadowed by the function arg that requests the fixture; one wayto resolve this is to name the decorated function ``fixture_<fixturename>`` and then use ``@pytest.fixture(name='<fixturename>')``.
 - **unpack_into**: an optional iterable of names, or string containing coma-separated names, for additional fixtures to create to represent parts of this fixture. See [`unpack_fixture`](#unpack_fixture) for details.
 - **hook**: an optional hook to apply to each fixture function that is created during this call. The hook function will be called everytime a fixture is about to be created. It will receive a single argument (the function implementing the fixture) and should return the function to use. For example you can use `saved_fixture` from `pytest-harvest` as a hook in order to save all such created fixtures in the fixture store.
 - **kwargs**: other keyword arguments for `@pytest.fixture`

### `unpack_fixture`

```python
def unpack_fixture(argnames: str,
                   fixture: Union[str, Callable],
                   in_cls: bool = False,
                   hook: Callable = None
                   ) -> Tuple[<Fixture>, ...]
```

Creates several fixtures with names `argnames` from the source `fixture`. Created fixtures will correspond to elements unpacked from `fixture` in order. For example if `fixture` is a tuple of length 2, `argnames="a,b"` will create two fixtures containing the first and second element respectively.

The created fixtures are automatically registered into the callers' module, but you may wish to assign them to variables for convenience. In that case make sure that you use the same names, e.g. `a, b = unpack_fixture('a,b', 'c')`.

```python
import pytest
from pytest_cases import unpack_fixture, fixture

@fixture
@pytest.mark.parametrize("o", ['hello', 'world'])
def c(o):
    return o, o[0]

a, b = unpack_fixture("a,b", c)

def test_function(a, b):
    assert a[0] == b
```

You can also use this function inside a class with `in_cls=True`. In that case you MUST assign the output of the function to variables, as the created fixtures won't be registered with the encompassing module.

```python
import pytest
from pytest_cases import unpack_fixture, fixture

@fixture
@pytest.mark.parametrize("o", ['hello', 'world'])
def c(o):
    return o, o[0]

class TestClass:
    a, b = unpack_fixture("a,b", c, in_cls=True)

    def test_function(self, a, b):
        assert a[0] == b
```

**Parameters**

 - **argnames**: same as `@pytest.mark.parametrize` `argnames`.
 - **fixture**: a fixture name string or a fixture symbol. If a fixture symbol is provided, the created fixtures will have the same scope. If a name is provided, they will have scope='function'. Note that in practice the performance loss resulting from using `function` rather than a higher scope is negligible since the created fixtures' body is a one-liner.
 - **in_cls**: a boolean (default `False`). You may wish to turn this to `True` to use this function inside a class. If you do so, you **MUST** assign the output to variables in the class.
 - **hook**: an optional hook to apply to each fixture function that is created during this call. The hook function will be called everytime a fixture is about to be created. It will receive a single argument (the function implementing the fixture) and should return the function to use. For example you can use `saved_fixture` from `pytest-harvest` as a hook in order to save all such created fixtures in the fixture store.

**Outputs:** the created fixtures.

### `fixture_union`

```python
def fixture_union(name: str,
                  fixtures: Iterable[Union[str, Callable]],
                  scope: str = "function",
                  idstyle: Optional[str] = 'compact',
                  ids: Union[Callable, Iterable[str]] = None,
                  unpack_into: Iterable[str] = None,
                  autouse: bool = False,
                  hook: Callable = None,
                  **kwargs) -> <Fixture>
```

Creates a fixture that will take all values of the provided fixtures in order. That fixture is automatically registered into the callers' module, but you may wish to assign it to a variable for convenience. In that case make sure that you use the same name, e.g. `a = fixture_union('a', ['b', 'c'])`

The style of test ids corresponding to the union alternatives can be changed with `idstyle`. Three values are allowed:

 - `'explicit'` favors readability with names as `<union>/<alternative>`,
 - `'compact'` (default) adds a small mark so that at least one sees which parameters are union alternatives and 
    which others are normal parameters: `/<alternative>`
 - `None` or `'nostyle'` provides minimalistic ids : `<alternative>`   

See `UnionIdMakers` class for details.

You can also pass a callable `idstyle` that will receive instances of `UnionFixtureAlternative`. For example `str` 
leads to very explicit ids: `<union>/<idx>/<alternative>`. See `UnionFixtureAlternative` class for details.


**Parameters:**

 - `name`: the name of the fixture to create
 - `fixtures`: an array-like containing fixture names and/or fixture symbols
 - `scope`: the scope of the union. Since the union depends on the sub-fixtures, it should be smaller than the smallest scope of fixtures referenced.
 - `idstyle`: The style of test ids corresponding to the union alternatives. One of `'explicit'`, `'compact'`,`'nostyle'`/`None`, or a callable (e.g. `str`) that will receive instances of `UnionFixtureAlternative`.
 - `unpack_into`: an optional iterable of names, or string containing coma-separated names, for additional fixtures to create to represent parts of this fixture. See `unpack_fixture` for details.
 - `ids`: as in pytest. The default value returns the correct fixture
 - `autouse`: as in pytest
 - `hook`: an optional hook to apply to each fixture function that is created during this call. The hook function will be called everytime a fixture is about to be created. It will receive a single argument (the function implementing the fixture) and should return the function to use. For example you can use `saved_fixture` from `pytest-harvest` as a hook in order to save all such created fixtures in the fixture store.
 - `kwargs`: other pytest fixture options. They might not be supported correctly.

**Outputs:** the new fixture. Note: you do not need to capture that output in a symbol, since the fixture is automatically registered in your module. However if you decide to do so make sure that you use the same name.

### `param_fixtures`

```python
def param_fixtures(argnames: str,
                   argvalues: Iterable[Any],
                   autouse: bool = False,
                   ids: Union[Callable, Iterable[str]] = None, 
                   scope: str = "function",
                   hook: Callable = None,
                   debug: bool = False,
                   **kwargs) -> Tuple[<Fixture>]
```

Creates one or several "parameters" fixtures - depending on the number or coma-separated names in `argnames`. The created fixtures are automatically registered into the callers' module, but you may wish to assign them to variables for convenience. In that case make sure that you use the same names, e.g. `p, q = param_fixtures('p,q', [(0, 1), (2, 3)])`.


Note that the `(argnames, argvalues, ids)` signature is similar to `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for consistency, see [pytest doc on parametrize](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html?highlight=pytest.param#pytest-mark-parametrize).

```python
import pytest
from pytest_cases import param_fixtures, param_fixture

# create a 2-tuple parameter fixture
arg1, arg2 = param_fixtures("arg1, arg2", [(1, 2), (3, 4)])

@pytest.fixture
def fixture_uses_param2(arg2):
    ...

def test_uses_param2(arg1, arg2, fixture_uses_param2):
    ...
```

**Parameters:**

 - `argnames`: same as `@pytest.mark.parametrize` `argnames`.
 - `argvalues`: same as `@pytest.mark.parametrize` `argvalues`.
 - `autouse`: see fixture `autouse`
 - `ids`: same as `@pytest.mark.parametrize` `ids`
 - `scope`: see fixture `scope`    
 - `hook`: an optional hook to apply to each fixture function that is created during this call. The hook function will be called everytime a fixture is about to be created. It will receive a single argument (the function implementing the fixture) and should return the function to use. For example you can use `saved_fixture` from `pytest-harvest` as a hook in order to save all such created fixtures in the fixture store.
 - `kwargs`: any other argument for the created 'fixtures'

### `param_fixture`

```python
param_fixture(argname, argvalues, 
              autouse=False, ids=None, hook=None, scope="function", **kwargs)
              -> <Fixture>
```

Identical to `param_fixtures` but for a single parameter name, so that you can assign its output to a single variable.


### `@parametrize`

```python
def parametrize(argnames: str=None,
                argvalues: Iterable[Any]=None,
                indirect: bool = False,
                ids: Union[Callable, Iterable[str]] = None,
                idstyle: Union[str, Callable] = None,
                idgen: Union[str, Callable] = _IDGEN,
                auto_refs: bool = True,
                scope: str = None,
                hook: Callable = None,
                scope: str = "function",
                debug: bool = False,
                **args)
```

Equivalent to `@pytest.mark.parametrize` but also supports 

**New alternate style for argnames/argvalues**. One can also use `**args` to pass additional `{argnames: argvalues}` in the same parametrization call. This can be handy in combination with `idgen` to master the whole id template associated with several parameters. Note that you can pass coma-separated argnames too, by de-referencing a dict: e.g. `**{'a,b': [(0, True), (1, False)], 'c': [-1, 2]}`.

**New alternate style for ids**. One can use `idgen` instead of `ids`. `idgen` can be a callable receiving all parameters at once (`**args`) and returning an id ; or it can be a string template using the new-style string formatting where the argnames can be used as variables (e.g. `idgen=lambda **args: "a={a}".format(**args)` or `idgen="my_id where a={a}"`). The special `idgen=AUTO` symbol can be used to generate a default string template equivalent to `lambda **args: "-".join("%s=%s" % (n, v) for n, v in args.items())`. This is enabled by default if you use the alternate style for argnames/argvalues (e.g. if `len(args) > 0`), and if there are no `fixture_ref`s in your argvalues.

**New possibilities in argvalues**:

 - one can include *references to fixtures* with [`fixture_ref(<fixture>)`](#fixture_ref) where <fixture> can be the fixture name or fixture function. When such a fixture reference is detected in the argvalues, a new function-scope "union" fixture will be created with a unique name, and the test function will be wrapped so as to be injected with the correct parameters from this fixture. Special test ids will be created to illustrate the switching between the various normal parameters and fixtures. You can see debug print messages about all fixtures created using `debug=True`. New: from version `3.2` on, if `auto_refs=True` (default), `@parametrize` will automatically detect fixture symbols in the list of argvalues, and will create `fixture_ref`s automatically around them so that you don't need to.

 - one can include lazy argvalues with [`lazy_value(<valuegetter>, [id=..., marks=...])`](#lazy_value). A `lazy_value` is the same thing than a function-scoped fixture, except that the value getter function is not a fixture and therefore can neither be parametrized nor depend on fixtures. It should have no mandatory argument.

Both `fixture_ref` and `lazy_value` can be used to represent a single argvalue, or a whole tuple of argvalues when there are several argnames. Several of them can be used in a tuple.

Finally, `pytest.param` is supported even when there are `fixture_ref` and `lazy_value`. 

Here as for all functions above, an optional `hook` can be passed, to apply on each fixture function that is created during this call. The hook function will be called everytime a fixture is about to be created. It will receive a single argument (the function implementing the fixture) and should return the function to use. For example you can use `saved_fixture` from `pytest-harvest` as a hook in order to save all such created fixtures in the fixture store.

**Parameters**

 - `argnames`: same than in `@pytest.mark.parametrize`

 - `argvalues: same as in pytest.mark.parametrize except that `fixture_ref` and `lazy_value` are supported
 
 - `indirect`: same as in pytest.mark.parametrize. Note that it is not recommended and is not guaranteed to work in complex parametrization scenarii.

 - `ids`: same as in pytest.mark.parametrize. Note that an alternative way to create ids exists with `idgen`. Only one non-None `ids` or `idgen` should be provided.
 
 - `idgen`: an id formatter. Either a string representing a template, or a callable receiving all argvalues at once (as opposed to the behaviour in pytest ids). This alternative way to generate ids can only be used when `ids` is not provided (None). You can use the special `pytest_cases.AUTO` formatter to generate an automatic id with template `<name>=<value>-<name2>=<value2>-...`. `AUTO` is enabled by default if you use the alternate style for argnames/argvalues (e.g. if `len(args) > 0`), and if there are no `fixture_ref`s in your argvalues.
 
 - `idstyle`: This is mostly for debug. Style of ids to be used in the "union" fixtures generated by `@parametrize` if at least one `fixture_ref` is found in the argvalues. `idstyle` possible values are 'compact', 'explicit' or None/'nostyle' (default), or a callable. `idstyle` has no effect if no `fixture_ref` are present in the argvalues. As opposed to `ids`, a callable provided here will receive a `ParamAlternative` object indicating which generated fixture should be used.

 - `auto_refs`: a boolean. If this is `True` (default), argvalues containing fixture symbols will automatically be wrapped into a `fixture_ref`, for convenience.
        
 - `scope`: The scope of the union fixture to create if `fixture_ref`s are found in the argvalues. Otherwise same as in `pytest.mark.parametrize`.
   
 - `hook`: an optional hook to apply to each fixture function that is created during this call. The hook function will be called everytime a fixture is about to be created. It will receive a single argument (the function implementing the fixture) and should return the function to use. For example you can use `saved_fixture` from `pytest-harvest` as a hook in order to save all such created fixtures in the fixture store.
        
 - `debug`: print debug messages on stdout to analyze fixture creation (use pytest -s to see them)


### `lazy_value`

```python
def lazy_value(valuegetter: Callable[[], Any],
               id: str = None,
               marks: Union[Any, Sequence[Any]] = ()
               ) -> LazyValue
```

A reference to a value getter (an argvalue-providing callable), to be used in [`@parametrize`](#parametrize).

A `lazy_value` is the same thing than a function-scoped fixture, except that the value getter function is not a fixture and therefore can neither be parametrized nor depend on fixtures. It should have no mandatory argument. The underlying function will be called exactly once per test node.

By default the associated id is the name of the `valuegetter` callable, but a specific `id` can be provided otherwise. Note that this `id` does not take precedence over custom `ids` or `idgen` passed to `@parametrize`.

Note that a `lazy_value` can be included in a `pytest.param` without problem. In that case the id defined by `pytest.param` will take precedence over the one defined in `lazy_value` if any. The marks, however, will all be kept wherever they are defined.

**Parameters**

 - `valuegetter`: a callable without mandatory arguments
 - `id`: an optional id. Otherwise `valuegetter.__name__` will be used by default
 - `marks`: optional marks. `valuegetter` marks will also be preserved.

### `is_lazy`

```python
def is_lazy(argval) -> bool
```

Return `True` if `argval` is the outcome of processing a `lazy_value` through `@parametrize`. This encompasses parameters that are items of lazy tuples that are created when parametrizing several argnames with the same `lazy_value()`.

### `fixture_ref`

```python
def fixture_ref(fixture: Union[str, Fixture]
                )
```

A reference to a fixture to be used with [`@parametrize`](#parametrize). Create it with `fixture_ref(<fixture>)` where <fixture> can be the fixture name or actual fixture function.
